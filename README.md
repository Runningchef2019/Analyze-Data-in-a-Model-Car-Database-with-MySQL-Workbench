# Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench

Project Overview: This project, "Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench," focuses on supporting business decisions for the Mint Classics Company regarding warehouse optimization, including the potential closure of a storage facility. My goal is to showcase proficiency in SQL and data-driven decision-making to improve inventory management.

Objectives:

Explore current product inventory.
Identify factors influencing inventory reorganization/reduction.
Provide data-driven recommendations.

Tasks Completed:

Imported and set up the Mint Classics database using MySQL Workbench.
Analyzed warehouse capacity and product distribution.
Identified the number of products, warehouse capacities, and product lines stored in each warehouse.
Assessed product lines with the highest and lowest sales.
Created temporary tables to compare stock and sales, helping identify overstocked, understocked, and well-stocked products.

Warehouse Analysis and Recommendations:

Warehouse B has the highest inventory but also the highest number of overstocked products. Despite low sales performance, it has substantial capacity.
Warehouse C, with the lowest storage capacity, is underutilized at only 50% capacity, representing wasted space.
Recommended consolidating Warehouse C's inventory into Warehouse B to optimize space, reduce costs, and streamline operations.

Outcome: 

This consolidation will enhance warehouse space utilization, streamline inventory management, and cut operational costs, aligning with the goal of maximizing operational effectiveness and promoting growth.
